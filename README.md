# Ansible Role: OpenJDK Java

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/peopledoc/ansible-role-java.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/peopledoc/ansible-role-java)

Installs OpenJDK Java for RedHat/CentOS and Debian/Ubuntu linux servers.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values:

    # The defaults provided by this role are specific to each distribution.
    java_packages:
      - java-1.7.0-openjdk

Set the version/development kit of Java to install, along with any other necessary Java packages.
By default, it will try to install OpenJDK 8, even if it is not feasible (it will fail, in that case).

CA certificates can be added to the java keystore with the following variables:

```yaml
ca_certificates_password: ...    # Role default: "changeit", but you should define your own from vault
devsecops_ca_enabled: True|False # Role default: true, for the local should be false 
app_certificates:                # Role default: [], the app can define its own certificates
  - alias: ...
    path: ...
```

```yaml
    keep_oracle_jdk: false
    add_bouncycastle: true
```

This role uninstall OracleJDK by default. You can change the
`keep_oracle_jdk` variable to keep it. This is only available on
Debian distributions. `add_bouncycastle` can be used to add
bouncycastle libs to the JDK.

## Dependencies

## Dependencies for tests

The dependencies are `ansible`, `molecule` and `docker-py` Python packages.

## Tests
